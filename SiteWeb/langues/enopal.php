				OPAL GUI is a Java project that I developed during my third year of university of computing sciences.
				My colleagues and me must devolop a GUI to use the OPAL library.
			</p>
			<p>
				To summarize, OPAL (Open Platform Access Library) is a open source java library which follow Global Platform spécifications, and gives several features
				(cap file manipulation, smart card management,..). 
			</p>
			<p>
				Our work was to develop several process :
				<ul> 
					<li> Card authentication process </li> 
					<li> Applet installation on the card</li> 
					<li> Applet selection on the card</li> 
					<li> Applet delete on the card</li> 
					<li> Applet send APDU </li> 
				</ul> 
			</p>
			<p>
				This project was so enriching. I acquired many technical experiences. In this project we used the design pattern MVC, is the primary Java GUI widget toolkit Swing, JavaCard technology, Mercurial to manage software versions and Maven to manage the production.
