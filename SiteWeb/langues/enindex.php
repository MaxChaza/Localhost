				Welcome in my website!
	</p>
	<p>
				I\'m engineer in Bioinformatic.

				My interests turn around the software development as well as web development which is adapted to the species\' biology. 
				My aim is to integrate a firm or organization to develop software which permits biologic innovations or to show bad influences of certain products.
	</p>
				Now I present my projects, experiments, research which I carried for my personal needs, or for projects carried during my university course.
