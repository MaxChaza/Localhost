				Welcome in my website!
	</p>
	<p>
				I\'m Master student in Bioinformatic at the University Paul Sabatier of Toulouse.

				My interests turn around the software development as well as web development which is adapted to the species\' biology. 
				My aim is to integrate a firm or organization to develop software which permits biologic innovations or to show bad influences of certain products.
	</p>
				Now I present my projects, experiments, research which I carried for my personal needs, or for projects carried during my university course.
